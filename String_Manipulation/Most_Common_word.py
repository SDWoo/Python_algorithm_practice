# Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned,
# return the most frequent word that is not banned.
# It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.
# The words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.

# Input: paragraph = "a.", banned = []
# Output: "a"

# Solution
